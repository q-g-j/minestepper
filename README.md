**Minesweeper**

A small console based clone of Minesweeper to teach myself C++.

***Features:***
- cursor navigation through the arrow keys
- colored numbers, flags and mines.
- auto-revealing of safe cells with no neighbor mines
- press ENTER on a number to auto-reveal safe cells similar to the Windows-version (if flags are placed right)

It compiles and runs in Linux and Windows but might look a bit different on both, depending on the terminal(-settings) used.

To compile you can use cmake + make or import into some IDE (like KDevelop, VSCode...).
